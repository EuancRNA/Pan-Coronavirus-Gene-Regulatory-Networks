# SARS-CoV-2 Notes

## General description

*_Structure_*
Enveloped virus with a +ve sense, ssRNA genome of ~ 30kb. Coronavirus genomes are the largest of any RNA virus families. Viral tx's are 5' capped, 3' PolyA-tailed.

*_Phylogeny_*
$\beta$-coronavirus, sub-family _Coronavirinae_, family _Coronaviridae_, order _Nidovirales_.
Other $\beta$-coronaviruses include MERS, SARS-CoV, 80 & 50% homology, respectively. Most-related to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and as such bats are believed to be their reservoir.

*_Pathogenesis_*
$\beta$-coronaviuses known to infect avian & mammalian hosts.

*_Genome Structure_*
Upon cell entry, genomic RNA is translated to produce non-structural proteins (nsps) from 2 ORFs;
* ORF1a --> Polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 440-500 kDa), cleaved into 11 nsps
* ORF1b --> -1 ribosome frameshift occurs immediately upstream of ORF1a stop codon which allows for continued translation to get longer (740-810kDa) pp1ab, cleaved into 16 nsps

Proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases nsp3 & nsp5 which harbour a papain-like protease domain and 3C-like protease domain, respectively

*_Replication & Transcription_*
Viral genome is used as a template for transcription and genome replication, mediated by nsp12 harboring RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) activity. Negative strand RNA intermediates are generated to serve as the templates for the synthesis of +ve sense genomic & sub-genomic RNA (gRNAs & sgRNAs). Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) & Nucleocapsid (N), alongside accessory proteins 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 10. Accessory proteins aren't experimentally verified for expression. The gRNA is packaged into structural proteins to form progeny virions.

*_Structure of transcribed RNAs_*
Coronaviral RNAs contain the common 5' leader sequence of 70-100 nt fused to the "body" sequence from the 3' end of the genome. Leader-to-body fusion occurs during -ve strand synthesis at short motifs called transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) located immediately adjacent to ORFs. TRS's contain a conserved 6-7nt core seq (CS) surrounded by variable sequences: During -ve strand synthesis, RdRp pauses when it crosses a TRS in the body (TRS-B) and switches the template to the TRS in the leader (TRS-L), resulting in leader-to-body fusion. From the fused -ve strand intermediates, +ve strand mRNAs are transcribed. Not proven if this is true for SARS-CoV-2, however. Some transcripts produced by coronaviruses contain partial sequences of and compete for viral proteins; known as "Defective Interfering RNAs or DI-RNAs".
