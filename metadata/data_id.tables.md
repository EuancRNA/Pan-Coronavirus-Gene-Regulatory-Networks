**Interesting Sources**
Paper released that does Nanopore RNA-seq & proteomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero 6 cells: however they show that the polybasic Furin site is lost upon passaging. This site is important for viral tropism and pathogenicity, so might not be representative of the actual virus - https://zenodo.org/record/3722591#.XoUXr3VKjIU
