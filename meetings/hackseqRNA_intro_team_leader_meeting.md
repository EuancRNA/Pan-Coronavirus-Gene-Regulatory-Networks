## Using ORCA or Compute Canada

Both are accessed the same way, can do file transfer using ie FileZilla

Enter ssh username@MACHINE
Put in password

ORCA is very bioinformatics-related, meant to be easy as possible to log on and do the analysis. 
Need to upload data to ORCA before hackathon
Send any software to be installed prior to start
